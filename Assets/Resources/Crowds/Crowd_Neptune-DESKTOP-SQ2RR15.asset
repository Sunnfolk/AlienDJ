  text: "What makes a good holiday for you? Sea? Swimming pools? Bodies of water?
    Why not have entire regions of water? With Neptune\u2019s artificial H20-pods
    you can definitely satiate whatever watery needs you have. With cocktail bars,
    aquariums, waterparks, even swimming lessons for your fellow tourists; There
    is more than enough to put Atlantis to shame. So come and splash around Neptune,
    and allow your new axolotl friends to show you a good time.\n\nEtiquette: Chum
    and kibble are needed when asking for directions or giving belly rubs.\n"
