  text: "There\u2019s not enough that can be said for our surprise newcomers to this
    happy celestial family. Being long since lost to us when the *prehistoric* travesty
    that was the *Meteor*-strike on *Earth*, the Natives of Planet X have made their
    long arduous journey back to us. Hailing from *Quastar nerjoras*, a distant galaxy
    from us, they are keen to catch-up on missed events! And so are more than ready
    to invite tourist\u2019s into their great republic. They are such good hosts
    that you may find it difficult to leave! As great conversationalists and all
    supreme and powerful overseers, there is truly no reason not to visit Planet
    X for a well intentioned catch-up.\n\n\nEtiquette: ALWAYS PRAISE EMPEROR KHAPTAK"
