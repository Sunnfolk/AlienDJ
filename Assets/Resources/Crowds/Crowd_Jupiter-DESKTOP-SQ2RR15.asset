  text: "Nothing beats skydiving, and on Jupiter that\u2019s all you\u2019ll ever
    need. Provided that you enter one of the Green light regions, you will have a
    blast! Though if perpetual falling isn\u2019t your thing, you're in luck! The
    endless winds and thunderstorms allow for any B\xD8LT\u2122 certified starcraft
    to freely tour the various structures that home the Native people here; Very
    sociable and friendly, you need not worry about making good impressions or even
    what to say! As they can read your deepest thoughts for you! With a company like
    that, who wouldn\u2019t want to stay in a place like this.\n\nEtiquette: don\u2019t
    keep lightning strikes to yourself, sharing is caring!\n"
